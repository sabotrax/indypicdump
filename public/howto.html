      <strong>How-to indypicdump</strong><br />
      <p>
	<strong>General information</strong>
	<ul>
	  <li>&middot; We'll create a random username for you. You may like it or not.</li>
	  <li>&middot; Your pictures won't show up immediately. Allow up to 30 minutes for processing.</li>
	  <li>&middot; Pictures are displayed randomly. Just wait 15 seconds.</li>
	   <li>&middot; Send one picture only per mail or check "Picture groups" below.</li>
	  <li>&middot; Send pictures as attachments, not inline.</li>
	  <li>&middot; Keep pictures larger than 400 pixels on the longest side.</li>
	  <li>&middot; Usernames are bound to email addresses. We'll create a new username for every address you send from. See "Adding email addresses to usernames" later in this document.</li>
	</ul>
      </p>
      <p>
	<strong>Dumps</strong>
	<ul>
	  <li id="section1.1"><strong>States</strong></li>
	  <br />
	  <li>&middot; Dumps can have three different states. That is open, hidden and protected.</li>
	  <li>&middot; Open dumps show up in the <a href="/dump/list">list of dumps</a> and can viewed by anyone.</li>
	  <li>&middot; Hidden dumps are not listed, but still can be viewed by anyone who is knowing the URL.</li>
	  <li>&middot; Protected dumps again do show up, but can only be viewed after entering a keyword.</li>
	  <li>&middot; Newly created dumps are open by default.</li>
	  <br />
	  <li id="section1.2"><strong>Setting a state</strong></li>
	  <br />
	  <li>&middot; To hide or open a dump, send an email to me@indypicdump.com with the subject "set name-of-dump hidden" or "set name-of-dump open".</li>
	  <li>&middot; If you want to protect a dump, make the subject "set name-of-dump protected" and put _password "some secret"_ in the body (without the underscores).</li>
	  <li>&middot; The password has to be 8 chars long at least.</li>
	  <li>&middot; You will have to reply to a confirmation mail before changes will apply.</li>
	  <li>&middot; At the moment, only the creator of a dump (call him dump admin) can change it's state.</li>
	</ul>
      </p>
      <p>
	<strong>Pictures</strong>
	<ul>
	  <li id="section2.1"><strong>Picture groups</strong></li>
	  <br />
	  <li>&middot; In addition to sending single pictures you can also post groups. Picture groups consist of three pictures and are always displayed in a row.</li>
	  <li>&middot; To post a group send three pictures attached to one mail with the subject "group" to your favorite dump.</li>
	  <li>&middot; The first picture attached will also be the first in the group etc.</li>
	  <li>&middot; If one picture fails an upload test, then the whole group fails.</li>
	  <li>&middot; Picture groups are displayed less often that single pictures. But not much.</li>
	  <br />
	  <li id="section2.2"><strong>Deleting pictures</strong></li>
	  <br />
	  <li>&middot; You can delete pictures by sending an email to <a href="mailto:me@indypicdump.com?subject=remove pictures">me@indypicdump.com</a> with the subject "remove pictures" and the picture filenames in the body.</li>
	  <li>&middot; The most easiest way to obtain a filename is by right-clicking a picture while it is displayed and choosing "Copy URL" in the context menu. Then paste the whole url into the body of the mail.</li>
	  <li>&middot; After confirming your request, the pictures will not be displayed any more and finally removed after 24 hours.</li>
	  <li>&middot; You can, however, cancel your request by sending an email to <a href="mailto:me@indypicdump.com?subject=keep pictures">me@indypicdump.com</a> with the subject "keep pictures". This will cancel all pending removal requests.</li>
	</ul>
      </p>
      <p>
	<strong>User Management</strong><br />
	<ul>
	  <li id="section3.1"><strong>Adding email addresses to usernames</strong></li>
	  <br />
	  <li>&middot; You have, for example, been sending pictures from speedy@gonzales.com as "yellow sombrero" but want to post from nacho@doctorcheese.com as the same user.</li>
	  <li>&middot; Send an email from nacho@doctorcheese.com to <a href="mailto:me@indypicdump.com">me@indypicdump.com</a> with the subject "i am yellow sombrero".</li>
	  <li>&middot; You'll receive a confirmation email to speedy@gonzales.com.</li>
	  <br />
	  <li id="section3.2"><strong>Accepting and declining messages</strong></li>
	  <br />
	  <li>&middot; There is a messaging system so you can have feedback on your pictures. It's turned off by default but in turning it on visitors of the website can rant at you or express their respect and admiration.</li>
	  <li>&middot; To accept messages send an email to <a href="mailto:me@indypicdump.com?subject=accept messages">me@indypicdump.com</a> with the subject "accept messages".</li>
	  <li>&middot; You'll receive a confirmation email to complete the process.</li>
	  <li>&middot; Use "<a href="mailto:me@indypicdump.com?subject=decline messages">decline messages</a>" accordingly.</li>
	  <br />
	  <li id="section3.3"><strong>Inviting users to dumps (also inviting new users)</strong></li>
	  <br />
	  <li>&middot; If you are a member of a dump you can invite others to it (you'll be automatically if you created it).</li>
	  <li>&middot; Send an email to <a href="mailto:me@indypicdump.com">me@indypicdump.com</a> with the subject "open name-of-dump for someone@somehost.com".</li>
	  <li>&middot; After your confirmation and if the person you invited is already using indypicdump she can start adding pictures to the dump outright.</li>
	  <li>&middot; New users but will get an invitation.</li>
	  <br />
	  <li id="section3.4"><strong>Marking messages as read (removing the bang)</strong></li>
	  <br />
	  <li>&middot; You might have detected an exclamation mark behind your username sometimes. The system then has a message for you like that you sent a duplicate picture oder posted to the wrong dump.</li>
	  <li>&middot; A single message normally shows up for a week, but that might be too long for you.</li>
	  <li>&middot; You can mark these messages as read by sending an email to <a href="mailto:me@indypicdump.com?subject=did read">me@indypicdump.com</a> with the subject "did read".</li>
	  <br />
	  <li id="section3.5"><strong>Statistics</strong></li>
	  <br />
	  <li>&middot; You can request some statistics about your account by sending an email to <a href="mailto:me@indypicdump.com?subject=stats please">me@indypicdump.com</a> with the subject "stats please".</li>
	</ul>
